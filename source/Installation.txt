Installation:

First make sure you have Steam installed, you can download it from the official website at "this" link.


1. Create a user on your computer called "Steam", without writing quotes, it is important to be a local user and call it exactly that they are case sensitive. You must create it without a password and with administrator privileges. Look at the control panel, users options ... etc

2. Log into the new user account (Steam) you created.

3. Copy the "source" (yeah, called source) folder in C:\ without changing the name. Otherwise it won't work.

4. Run "SetSteamShell.vbs" file, a window opens, select the user account "Steam" you've created before and uncheck the box at the top, another window opens. Leave the password blank and click OK in both windows.

Ready, restart your computer and start to steam.
